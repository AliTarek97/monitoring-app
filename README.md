# Monitoring app

main idea of the task is to build an uptime monitoring RESTful API server which allows authorized users to enter URLs they want monitored, and get detailed uptime reports about their availability, average response time, and total uptime/downtime.

## Proposed Flow

- The user will register passing email and password, After that He will receive a verification email.
- The user will be asked to log in into the monitoring platfrom before using any API.
- The authorized user is able to create checks and request a report at the end.
